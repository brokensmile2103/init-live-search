== Description ==

Deliver an ultra-responsive search experience to your visitors — no page reloads, no jQuery, no lag. Init Live Search is a modern, lightweight, and fully accessible live search solution for WordPress — now with tag-aware matching, SEO metadata support, ACF integration, WooCommerce product filters, and customizable UI presets.

Perfect for content-heavy blogs, WooCommerce stores, or even headless sites. Every interaction is fast, fluid, and designed to work across devices.

It also brings AI-powered related posts and an advanced keyword generator — giving your visitors smarter ways to discover content.

This plugin is part of the [Init Plugin Suite](https://en.inithtml.com/init-plugin-suite-minimalist-powerful-and-free-wordpress-plugins/) — a collection of minimalist, fast, and developer-focused tools for WordPress.

  - Uses multi-signal scoring (tags, series, title bigrams, same_keyword via ACF, category, views, comments, freshness)  
  - Shares templates with `[init_live_search_related_posts]` (no extra styling needed)  
  - Fully filterable via new developer hooks: `ai_candidates`, `ai_signals`, `ai_weights`, `ai_score`

  - New filters added for AI related posts and keyword signals  
  - Complete list now includes over 20 filters (`*_fallback`, `*_post_ids`, `*_results`, `*_weights`, `*_commands`, etc.)  
  - Developers can hook into candidate pools, signal scores, and schema output with fine-grained control

- **Performance Optimizations**  
  - Smarter candidate pooling for related posts (recent + context-based)  
  - Pre-cached scoring loop for AI signals to minimize queries  
  - Safer regex handling in keyword processing to avoid PCRE errors  
  - Reduced memory footprint in bigram statistics without sacrificing accuracy

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin use jQuery? =  
No. It's built entirely with modern Vanilla JavaScript — no jQuery, no external dependencies.

= Can I insert the search box anywhere on the page? =  
Yes. Use the `[init_live_search]` shortcode to insert a search input or icon anywhere. You can also add custom classes or enable dark mode.

= How is the search triggered? =  
By default, it binds to any `<input name="s">`. You can also trigger it via:  
- Ctrl + / (or Cmd + /)  
- Triple-click on blank space  
- Text selection tooltip  
- `?modal=search` in the URL  
- Any element with `data-ils` attribute

= Can I prefill the modal from a link? =  
Yes. Append `?modal=search&term=your+keyword` or `#search` to any URL to prefill the modal and trigger it.

= Is voice search supported? =  
Yes. It uses the browser’s SpeechRecognition API with auto-stop, language detection, and error handling.

= What are slash commands? =  
Slash commands are typed commands starting with `/`, such as:  
- `/recent` — show latest posts  
- `/tag seo` — filter by tag  
- `/category news` — filter by category  
- `/id 123` — fetch a post by ID  
- `/fav`, `/fav_clear` — manage favorites  
- `/random` — show a random post  
- `/history`, `/history_clear` — manage recent search history  

**If WooCommerce is active:**  
- `/product`, `/sku`, `/price`, `/stock`, `/on-sale`, `/coupon`  

**If other Init plugins are active:**  
- `/popular`, `/trending`, `/day`, `/week`, `/month` — via **Init View Count**  
- `/read` — via **Init Reading Position**

You can disable slash commands entirely in the plugin settings. Developers can register custom ones using the `init_plugin_suite_live_search_commands` filter.

= What is the Quick Search tooltip? =  
When users select 1–8 words, a floating tooltip appears to trigger an instant search. You can configure or disable it in settings.

= Does it support synonyms or alternate keywords? =  
Yes. You can define custom keyword → synonym mappings via the **Synonyms** tab in settings.  
When enabled, the plugin will auto-expand search terms using these synonyms if few results are found.

= Can it search in SEO fields and tags? =  
Yes. The plugin supports a special “Smart Tag-Aware” mode that matches both post titles and tags.  
It can also search inside SEO Titles and Meta Descriptions from plugins like Yoast SEO, Rank Math, AIOSEO, The SEO Framework, and SEOPress.

= Does it support WooCommerce? =  
Yes. You can search for products by:  
- Keyword  
- SKU  
- Price range (`/price`)  
- Stock status (`/stock`)  
- Sale status (`/on-sale`)  
- Brand, attribute, variation, and coupons (`/coupon`)

Results include title, price, stock status, and Add to Cart links.

= Does it support excerpts in search results? =  
Yes. It generates a 1-line contextual excerpt with the keyword highlighted for better scan-ability.

= Can this plugin automatically display related posts without using a shortcode? =  
Yes. In the plugin settings, you can choose to automatically insert related posts after the content or around the comment section.  
It uses the `[init_live_search_related_posts]` shortcode internally with a default layout.  
You can still use the shortcode manually for full control.

= Can I override or disable the plugin’s CSS? =  
Yes. You can:  
- Drop `init-live-search/style.css` in your theme  
- Choose a built-in preset (`style-full.css`, `style-topbar.css`)  
- Or disable all built-in CSS and style it from scratch

= Is it mobile-friendly? =  
Yes. The modal is responsive with mobile optimizations like excerpt clamping and floating mic button.

= Is result caching supported? =  
Yes. It uses `localStorage` to cache search results and reduce repeat queries.

= Does the plugin track user data? =  
Only if **Search Analytics** is enabled. It logs:  
- Search term  
- Timestamp  
- Result count  
No personal information (IP, user agent, etc.) is stored.

= What happens if I press Enter without selecting a result? =  
The plugin will redirect to WordPress’s default search results page.

= Can I use this in a headless setup? =  
Yes. All features are powered by REST API (`initlise/v1`) — ideal for decoupled frontends.

= Can I preload a default slash command when the modal opens? =  
Yes. In settings, you can define a default command like `/recent`, `/read`, or `/related`. There's also a "smart detection" mode based on page context.

= Does it support multiple languages? =  
Yes. It auto-detects the active language when Polylang or WPML is installed. You can also filter results via `init_plugin_suite_live_search_filter_lang`.
